# ThunderPHP - A Plugin-Based PHP MVC Framework

ThunderPHP is a PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed to accelerate your web development projects by harnessing the power of plugins. Unlike starting from scratch with every project, ThunderPHP allows you to build upon a solid foundation, combining the flexibility of WordPress with the simplicity of lightweight frameworks like CodeIgniter.

## Features

- **Plugin-Based Architecture:** ThunderPHP adopts a plugin-centric approach, making it easy to extend and customize your web applications. Choose from a variety of plugins to add functionality and features as needed.

- **MVC Structure:** ThunderPHP follows the Model-View-Controller pattern, promoting a structured and organized codebase that separates concerns, enhances maintainability, and streamlines development.

- **Rapid Project Start:** With ThunderPHP, you can kickstart new projects faster, thanks to its pre-built plugins and framework capabilities. Spend less time on boilerplate code and more on creating unique and innovative web applications.

## Branches

1. **Master Branch:** The master branch contains the MVC structure with no plugins. It serves as the foundation for your framework.

2. **Main Branch:** The main branch is where all plugins are integrated. It represents the complete ThunderPHP framework with all available plugins.

3. **Plugin-Specific Branches:** Each plugin has its own dedicated branch, such as `menu-plugin` and `user-plugin`, to distinguish and manage development efforts for individual plugins.
